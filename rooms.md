Here is a list of assets for a Kowloon Walled City random room, along with a description of how they could be arranged. The goal is to create a sense of claustrophobia, decay, and lived-in chaos.
Asset List
Structural & Architectural:
 * Concrete Wall Panels: Generic, stained, and moldy concrete panels. Some should have exposed rebar.
 * Window Frame: A single, small, and grimy window frame. Could be partially boarded up.
 * Corrugated Metal Sheets: Rusting, dented, and used for patching walls or ceilings.
 * Exposed Pipes & Electrical Conduits: A network of PVC and metal pipes, some leaking, with dangling, bare electrical wires.
 * Wooden Beams & Planks: Rotting or splintered wood used for makeshift supports or furniture.
 * Air Conditioner Unit: A grimy, old window-mounted AC unit, with rust streaks running down the wall below it.
Furniture & Domestic Items:
 * Folding Cot or Bed Frame: A simple, metal folding cot with a thin, dirty mattress.
 * Small Wooden Table: A rickety, square table, likely with chipped paint.
 * Plastic Stool: A common, red or blue plastic stool, often found in markets.
 * Cardboard Boxes: Various sizes, some stacked, some torn open, and some with Chinese characters printed on them.
 * Piles of Clothes: A heap of faded, wrinkled clothing on the floor or a chair.
 * Cooking Pot & Wok: A single, old metal pot and a wok placed on a makeshift cooking surface.
 * Empty Bottles & Cans: A scattering of beer bottles, soda cans, and water bottles.
Clutter & Details:
 * Newspaper & Magazines: Rolled-up or crumpled newspapers and magazines, yellowed with age.
 * Faded Posters: A torn, faded poster of a movie star or an advertisement, tacked to the wall.
 * Hanging Laundry: A string of clothesline with a few pieces of damp laundry hanging from it.
 * Water Stains & Mold Patches: Decal textures for large water stains and splotches of mold on the walls and ceiling.
 * Electrical Outlets & Switches: Old, yellowed plastic outlets and light switches.
 * Plastic Shopping Bags: Discarded, crumpled plastic bags.
 * Piles of Trash: A small pile of general refuse, including food wrappers and broken items.
 * Incense Sticks & Holder: A small, simple incense holder with a few burnt-out sticks.
 * Flickering Light Bulb: A single, bare light bulb hanging from a wire, with a slight flicker effect.
Arrangement Principles for the 3D Generation Model
The key to a believable Kowloon Walled City room is not neatness, but a sense of organic, haphazard growth. Hereâ€™s how the assets should be arranged:
 * Start with the Structure:
   * Begin with the concrete walls, but introduce imperfections. The walls should not be perfectly aligned or smooth.
   * Place the window frame off-center and low to the ground, giving the impression of a cramped space. The window should be the primary source of dim, ambient light.
   * Introduce the corrugated metal sheets as patches, perhaps covering a section of wall or ceiling where a hole would be.
 * Create Verticality and Clutter:
   * The room should feel like it's been built on top of itself. The exposed pipes and electrical conduits are crucial here. They should not run in straight lines. Instead, they should snake along the walls and ceiling, intersecting and overlapping with each other. A good strategy is to have a dense bundle of them running diagonally across a corner.
   * Use the wooden beams and planks to create makeshift shelves or supports. They shouldn't be new wood; they should look salvaged and poorly fitted.
 * Place the "Lived-In" Items:
   * The furniture should be sparse and functional. The cot should be placed in a corner, often with the head of the bed against a wall to conserve space.
   * The small table can be placed next to the cot, serving as both a dining and work surface.
   * Stack the cardboard boxes in a corner, creating a small, claustrophobic tower. These can serve as storage or as another surface.

* Add a Layer of Decay and Neglect:
   * Apply the water stain and mold decals to the walls, particularly under the exposed pipes and below the window. The decay should look like a natural consequence of the environment.
   * Scatter the empty bottles, cans, and trash piles on the floor, especially in the corners and around the furniture.
   * The clothes pile and hanging laundry should not be neat. They are signs of everyday life in a cramped space. The hanging laundry adds to the visual clutter and breaks up the empty vertical space.
 * Finish with the Fine Details:
   * The flickering light bulb should be the central light source, hanging low to cast long, dramatic shadows.
   * The faded posters should be placed partially torn or peeling off the wall, competing for space with the exposed pipes and wires.
   * The incense holder can be placed on the table or a small ledge, a tiny touch of spiritual life amidst the chaos.
The overarching principle is that every item should feel like it has a history and a reason for being where it is, even if that reason is simple neglect. The arrangement should be a visual story of a person surviving and living in an extremely confined, decaying, and chaotic urban environment.
